# 🛡️ Basic Vulnerability Scanner

A simple Python-based scanner that checks a target IP for open ports and grabs service banners to identify potentially outdated or vulnerable services.

## 🔧 Features
- Scans 10+ common ports
- Banner grabbing
- Matches against a local JSON vulnerability database
- Highlights risks and known CVEs

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- `socket`
- `json`

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python3 scanner.py
```
Then enter a target IP, like 192.168.1.1.
